##Dirty development

Chinese miners last year dug up 3.87bn tonnes of coal, more than enough to keep all four of the next largest users – the United States, India, the European Union and Russia – supplied for a year.

去年，中国矿工挖了38.7亿吨的煤，比美国、印度、欧盟和俄罗斯四个地区一年的需求总和还要多，而这它们是仅次于中国的煤炭消费国。

The country is grappling with the direct costs of that coal, in miners' lives, crippling air pollution, expanding deserts and “environmental refugees”.

中国正在努力处理这一巨大的煤产量所带来的直接成本，即失去的矿工的生命、严重的空气污染、不断扩大的沙漠以及“环境难民”。

Desire for change contends with fears that cutting back on familiar technology could dent employment or slow growth, and efforts to cut consumption do not always mean a clampdown on mining.

这个国家在渴求变革的同时，却又担心放弃熟练的技术可能影响就业，或者减缓经济，而且虽然有降低煤炭消费的措施，但这并不总是表示要严格限制煤炭开采。

###Chapter 1 Black lung's long shadow
###第一章 尘肺病的阴影

Most of the mines burrowed into the parched hillsides of Wang Family Mountain have been closed for several years, but their shadow lingers in the blackened, failing lungs of the He family.

王家山上挖的大部分矿井都关闭多年，但其阴影仍存，就在何家一家人变黑、虚弱的肺里。

The mining carried He Jinbao off first, then two of his seven sons. Now two more He brothers are waiting to die, condemned by dust inhaled long ago on underground shifts.

采矿工作先是夺走了何金宝（音）的生命，紧接着他七个儿子里有两个也因此丧命。现在，又有两位何家兄弟在等待生命尽头的到来，过去在底下矿井工作时吸入的粉尘已注定了他们的结局。

The tiny airborne specks pose a risk few miners understand as they head down into the country's pits, haunted by the more immediate fear of the explosions and collapses which claim hundreds of lives each year.

很少有矿工认识到粉尘这种细微空气颗粒的危险，下井作业时时刻担心的是爆炸和坍塌这种每年多去数百条生命的事故，后者给矿工带来的恐惧更为直接。

“I never heard anyone mention black lung disease,” said He Quanfa, one of the two doomed brothers – there is no cure for the illness which slowly hardens the lungs as they try to expel trapped coal dust. “If I had, I might have worn a mask.”

“我从来没听人说过尘肺病”，何全发（音）说。他是何家两位患病的兄弟之一。这种病是不治之症，随着肺部不断试图排出吸进去的煤炭粉尘，肺部会逐渐硬化。“如果我听说过，我可能就会带个面具了。”

Already short of breath, he knows what little he can expect from the brief remains of his life because he watched the same disease ravage his father and brothers.

何全发现在呼吸已经比较困难了，他知道自己短暂的余生里能期待的并不多，因为他亲眼目睹了他的父亲和兄弟被尘肺病所折磨。

They all hung up their hard hats years before their diagnoses, and thought they had escaped the mines with not just their lives but also a tiny slice of the country's new-found prosperity. “Until 15 years ago, we lived in a cave,” says He, now 50.

确诊的时候，何家人都已经脱下安全帽很多年了，还曾庆幸自己不仅活着从矿山回来，还从国家繁荣中分了一小杯羹。现年50岁的何说，“15年前，我们家还住在山洞里呢。”

Instead he was already nursing an incurable disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers, and may claim up to six million more in coming years, one charity that works with sufferers estimates. Even conservative government data shows that each year the number of registered sufferers leaps by around a third.

但是，他现在却患上了绝症，据一家帮助患病者的慈善机构成，这个疾病已经造成数十万中国工人死亡，未来还可能多去六百多万人的性命。即使是保守的政府数据也显示，每年注册的患病者人数会增长约三分之一。

For the seven sons of the He family, the mines were the only route out of absolute poverty in their dusty corner of the northwest, where there was little farmland and less water to irrigate it.

对于何家的七兄弟，当矿工是他们摆脱绝对贫困的唯一途径，他们的家乡位于大西北某个贫瘠的角落，那里农田稀少，灌溉用水也少。

They all left school early, barely literate and all ended up in the mines.

七兄弟都很早就辍学了，几乎不识字，最后全部都下井采矿。

The cash they earned hacking out coal covered their children's school fees and built the brothers' first brick homes – quiet courtyards filled with sunlight, the soft songs of nesting swallows, and now a bitter sense of regret.

挖矿所挣的现金让他们交上了孩子的学费，盖起了砖房——但现在，院子里安安静静的，燕子筑起了巢在轻声歌词，何家人心里有些后悔了。

“He paid for this house with his life,” said He Quanfa's wife, waving listlessly at wooden beams, elegant calligraphy and a cabinet stuffed with medical papers and x-rays that chart the relentless decay of her husband's lungs. Last year five of his friends from the mine slipped away.

“这个房子是他用命换来的”，何全发的妻子说，一边指着房间里的木梁、书画和堆满了病历和X光照片的柜子，显得没精打采。柜子里的X光照片记录的是她丈夫肺部不断的恶化。去年，他的工友中有5位去世了。

He spent most of the winter watching TV in the kitchen, hooked up to an oxygen compressor and trying to stay warm and dry, terrified of catching a cold that could overwhelm his battered lungs.

冬天大部分时候，他都呆在厨房看电视，还必须连着一个氧气瓶。他时刻都得要保持身体暖活干燥，生怕万一感冒了，他那受尽折磨的肺会撑不下去。

He has not been able to work for years, so they survive on vegetables and melons grown by his wife and money sent home by two sons, riddled by guilt that the boys can't save up for marriage.

他失去劳动能力已经几年了，所以他们现在的生计就靠妻子种的蔬菜和西瓜，和两个儿子寄回家里的钱。这就导致两个孩子没法存钱结婚，对此他们心里也很内疚。

A few dozen metres away his younger brother He Quanying is even more desperate.

何全发家不远处，他的弟弟何全英甚至感到更绝望。

His disease is less advanced but it has shattered the family more profoundly, because his wife was badly injured in a road accident around the time that his lungs began seizing up, and she can no longer work at all.

他的病还没有那么严重，但对家庭的破坏性影响更大，因为他的肺开始肿大的时候，他的妻子正好遇到了交通事故，受伤很严重，导致失去了劳动能力。

They only eat two meals a day to help scrape together school fees for their son from a social security payment of 300 yuan a month (about £35). He is studying for an engineering diploma that will take a third generation into mining, but at least keep him further away from the deadly dust.

他们一天只吃两顿饭，这样才能从一个月300块的社保中省出儿子的学费。他们的孩子正在攻读一个工程学位，这个学位也和采矿有关，但至少不会接触致命的粉尘。

Two years ago the Love Save Pneumoconiosis charity paid for a lavage, or rinse of He Quanying's lungs, which eased the symptoms, but it cost more than the family scrapes together to live off in a year, so another is out of the question.

两年前，大爱清尘基金会资助了何全英的洗肺手术，术后病症有所缓解。但是费用比一家人攒下的一年生活费还要多，不可能再做这样的手术了。

“Talking about it is a waste of time,” he says. “I have no place to go complain because I got this disease from earning a living. Fair or not, we did it.”

“跟人说也是浪费时间”，他说到。“我无处申诉，因为我这病是因为要养家糊口得的。不管公不公平，我们已经得了这病。”

Even if he wanted to, there is no one to sue for compensation or petition for help with medical fees.

即使他想申诉，也没有找不到去起诉赔偿医疗费。

The private mine where he worked without contracts, insurance or protection shut around two years ago and the owner vanished soon after.

他工作的那家私人煤矿没和他们签合同，也没有提供保险和安全保障，而且两年前就关闭了，之后煤矿主就消失了。

The mine was probably a target of belated government efforts to halt the accidents that kill hundreds of men a year, and professionalise a critical sector, by closing down the small independent pits whose business model is usually based on bribing their way out of regulations.

那家煤矿很可能是政府大范围整改的目标，目的是减少每年事故死亡人数，另一个目的是，通过关停靠行贿躲避监管的私人小煤矿，以提高这个高危行业的专业性。

###Chapter 2 Peak coal and politics
###第二章 煤炭消费峰值和政治

Gathering worries about climate change and pollution have also have played a role in the shutdown though, pushing China to begin the enormous task of weaning itself off the dirty fuel that powered its boom years and still provides two-thirds of the country's energy.

对气候变化和污染问题的担忧与日俱增，这在关停煤矿的行动中也起了一定作用，迫使中国启动了削减煤矿消费的艰巨任务，毕竟煤矿驱动了它的繁荣发展，而且仍然占能源供给的三分之二。

Chinese miners last year dug up 3.87bn tonnes of coal, more than enough to keep all four of the next largest users – the United States, India, the European Union and Russia – supplied for a year.

去年，中国矿工挖了38.7亿吨的煤，比美国、印度、欧盟和俄罗斯四个地区一年的需求总和还要多，而这它们是仅次于中国的煤炭消费国。

Planners favoured it because coal is cheap, relatively easy to extract and transport and lies in plentiful seams under the country, minimising the need to court foreign suppliers. Unfortunately it is also very dirty, and a threat to national security.

政策制定者偏爱煤，是因为便宜，相对容易开采、运输，而且煤层资源丰富，这就大幅降低了寻求国外供给的需求。不幸的是，煤也是一种非常脏的资源，对国家安全也是一个威胁。

Air pollution in China, from its factories and power stations, has got so bad that it kills over half a million people a year, and China's image has been dented by countless stories of the choking air, children playing under air purification domes, others struggling behind face masks.

中国的工厂和发电厂所导致的空气污染，已经非常严重，每年导致逾50万人死亡。空气质量差、小孩在空气净化罩下玩耍和人们带着口罩艰难生活的报道层出不穷，这给中国的国家形象造成了不好影响。

Less visibly dramatic for now, but far more worrying to the government, is the threat coal poses to China's already scarce water supplies, its ability to feed itself and its vulnerability to extreme weather, by fuelling climate change.

由于烧煤会加剧气候变化，这对中国已然稀缺的水资源、自给自足的能力和应对极端天气的能力造成了威胁。目前这一威胁尚不明显，但却是政府更为担心的问题。

The Chinese government accepted the scientific evidence for global warming years ago, but still faced bitter internal debates over what to do about it.

中国政府多年前就已经接受了全球变暖的科学证据，但内部仍然在激烈地争论该如何应对。

Although it overtook the US nearly a decade ago to become the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, per person it still produces barely a third as much carbon dioxide as the US and half Russian levels.

虽然中国超越美国成为温室气体的第一大排放国已经有近10年了，但是中国的人均碳排放量仍不到美国的三分之和俄罗斯的一半。

Officials in Beijing looked at the dirty history of industrial development in the west, the terrible poverty still endemic in parts of their own country, which has per capita income below countries like Botswana and Iraq, and for many years bridled at being asked to sacrifice growth for efficiency.

北京的官员很了解西方工业发展的肮脏进程，又很清楚自己国家还有许多极其贫穷的地区，人均收入比博茨瓦纳和伊拉克这样的国家还要低。因此多年来一直对被要求牺牲经济、寻求效率的诉求感到不满。

As global climate negotiations stalled, China's own crises spurred the government into unilateral action.

随着全球的气候谈判停滞不前，中国自身的危机促使政府采取了单边行动。

It has poured so much investment into renewables that new wind, solar and hydropower stations installed last year alone could generate more electricity than all the power stations in Indonesia.

中国在可再生能源上的投入非常大，去年新增的风力发电站、太阳能发电站和水利发电站生产的电力，比印度尼西亚所有的发电站的发电量还要多。

That contributed to a drop in coal demand last year, the first in over a decade, a shift the government hopes is advance notice of a broader trend. Beijing has promised to cap demand, or reach “peak coal” by 2020.

这些投入使得去年煤炭需求十年来首次下降，而政府希望这一转变预示着能源变革的大趋势。北京已经承诺要限制需求，也就是在2020年前达到排放峰值。

The decline and the pledge are both an extraordinary triumph of political will, and there have been more cuts in coal use this year, all hailed by environmentalists.

煤炭需求下降和中国政府承诺都是政治意志所取得的卓越成就，今年削减了更多的煤炭使用，都受到环保主义者的吹捧。

The problem for those fighting to keep global warming within 2C though, is that Chinese demand has expanded so fast that anything short of a dramatic cut in coal use – something no one is even advocating – leaves terrifying amounts of carbon dioxide pumping into the atmosphere.

对致力于确保全球温度提升在2摄氏度以内的人来说，中国的能源需求增长速度非常之快也是一个问题，除非大幅削减煤炭使用（没有人倡导这一措施），否则还是会有大量的二氧化碳被排放至大气中。

The fuel China dug up last year alone will produce around 9bn tonnes of carbon dioxide as it burns, more than all the coal used around the world in 1990.

仅中国去年开采的煤炭就将产生约90吨的二氧化碳，比1990年全球煤炭使用的排放量还要打。

###Chapter 3 A city built from nothing
### 第三章 

One reason for Beijing's newfound urgency in chipping away at that staggering level of emissions can be found in the dusty, unprepossessing town of Hongsibu.

北京新近这么急切地想要降低碳排放量的一个原因，可以从满是尘土、不那么令人喜欢的红寺堡区窥见一些端倪。

Two decades ago, its streets were a rolling desert shooting range for the Chinese army. Today it is irrigated by water diverted from the Yellow River and is officially home to over 200,000 'environmental refugees' who were driven out of their homes by escalating drought and desertification.

20年前，这里的街道还是中国军队的沙漠射击训练场。今天，它从黄河引流获取灌溉用水，还是超过20万名“环境难民”的家，他们因为干旱和沙漠化被迫离开家园。

The resettlement project is the most ambitious of its kind in China and perhaps the world. Officials see it as a triumph of government benevolence and engineering. “Its a miracle in poverty reduction, to take a piece of wasteland and transform it,” said Zheng Yaliang, Communist party secretary for Hongsibu. “Very few countries could do this.”

这在中国，甚至是全世界，都可以说是最为野心勃勃的一个安置计划。官方把它看做政府善举的一大成就。“这是减贫方面的一个奇迹，将原来的一片废土地，变革一新”，红寺堡区的区委常委郑亚亮说。“很少有国家能做到这点。”

It was also very expensive. The original budget allowed around £300m to move 1 million people into town, but it has run to several times that much for a far smaller programme, with the last of around a quarter of a million official refugees arriving this year.

它的代价也很昂贵。起初的预算为约3亿英镑（约29亿元），安置1百万居民，但是现在预算已经膨胀到原来的数倍，安置的人数却只有25万人，其中最后一批安置居民今年抵达了红寺堡区。

The project was originally designed as simple poverty relief, but as China has come to understand the role climate change played in local conditions it has become a possible template for other parts of the country and a warning sign of the enormous, expensive and difficult shifts that warming temperatures will demand around the globe.

该项目原先只是设计为一个简单的扶贫减贫项目，但随着中国政府逐渐意识到气候变化对当地环境的影响，红寺堡安置项目也就成了全国其他地区的一个样板，同时也是应对气候变暖所需要的彻底、昂贵、艰巨的转变的警示。

The settlers came from an area of dry, rolling hills in central Ningxia region known as Xihaigu, a strange and inhospitable place even for a country criss-crossed by deserts, swamps, steppes and steep mountains.

定居的居民来自宁夏中部一个叫西海固的地方，那里干旱，山脉绵延起伏。即使对于一个沙漠、沼泽、草原和高山纵横交错的国家来说，那里都算是一个陌生、不适宜居住的地方。

“Three main factors led to the ecological fragility of Xihaigu: nature, human impact and climate change,” said Chen Shaojun, researcher for the National Research Center for Resettlement at Hohai University in Nanjing

“西海固生态脆弱，有三个主要原因：自然因素，人为影响和气候变化”，陈少军（音）说。他是南京河海大学中国移民研究中心的一名研究院。

Average temperatures in the area rose by more than 2C over the last 50 years and rainfall dropped by a third.

过去50年中，这个地区的平均温度上升了2摄氏度多，降雨量减少了三分之一。

That shift was enough to spell the end of villages like Zhoutao, perched on the side of rolling brown hills in southern Ningxia, over a thousand kilometres from Beijing and a world apart.

气候上的转变足以预示像周陶村（音）这样的村庄的结局，这些村庄大多位于宁夏南部山脉一侧，与北京相隔一千多公里，恍如两个世界一般。

###Chapter 4 The village left behind
### 第四章 被遗弃的村庄

Unlike almost everywhere else in China, the state is in retreat here. It is a community doomed by drought. The school is shuttered, its classrooms used as hay storage to feed goats and the village committee building, seat of Communist party power for decades, is abandoned.

与中国几乎所有其他地方不同，在这里，国家的力量在后退。这个地区常年干旱，学校空无一人，教室被用来存放喂羊的干草，几十年来一直是党支部办公地的村委会也被遗弃。

Up the unpaved main track most buildings lie in ruins, a handful of bricks marking the outline of an old wall. The few people who still live here flicker between houses like ghosts, shying away from visitors who never bring good news to a hamlet beyond reach of mobile phone networks.

沿着村庄里的主路往上走，大部分的屋子都荒废了，只能从残存的几块砖看出墙的轮廓。仍然居住在这里的人很少，他们不太爱见外面的人，总是躲着，因为外面的人从没带来过好消息，这里又没有手机信号覆盖。

There are no springs in the village, or natural wells, says farmer Wu Zhengfang, one of the few remaining residents. Instead underground tanks dug out by hand store the few inches of rain that fell each year, but as the population grew and the skies dried up, supplies often fell short.

村里见不到春天，也没有天然水井，农民吴正芳（音）告诉我们。吴是这里仅剩的几位居民之一。居民只能用手挖一些地下水箱，来存储每年少的可怜的降水，但是随着人口增长、天气逐渐干旱，供水常常不足。

“When the water ran out we had to get together and pay for a driver to bring a tank,” she said in the one-room house she has refused to leave after four years of government cajoling and orders. “And nine out of 10 years, we had drought.”

“雨水用完之后，我们不得不一起凑钱请司机进城买水”，她说。这几年，她一直呆在自己的只有一间屋子的房子里，政府曾连续4年劝诱、甚至命令她离开，但都被她拒绝了。她接着说，“十年有九年都会出现干旱”。

They spent over £500 on trucking water in when it ran out, half a year's earnings in a farming community.

雨水用尽之后他们会花500多英镑（约4800元）请人进城买水，这是一个务农的村子半年的收入。

Where migrants from other towns used wages to build new homes or educate their children, in Zhoutao people drank away their earnings.

当其他村子的移民用赚来的工资建新房子或给孩子交学费的时候，周陶村的村民却在不断花掉自己的积蓄，还是用在喝水上。

The whole region has grappled with water problems for centuries, a record left in place names like “Cry Out for Water” town. The problem became far more acute in recent decades though as a population boom and over-farming exacerbated the impact of fast-rising temperatures.

整个地区数百年来一直面临水问题，这也体现像“唤水镇”（意）这样的地名上。近几十年，由于人口增长以及过度种植加剧了气温上升的影响，导致这个问题比以往更加严重。

“Since 1978, autumn precipitation (in the area) has fallen 33%,” said Chen Shaojun, from the National Research Centre for Resettlement at Hohai University. “Climate change is a factor. The temperature has been increasing in Ningxia as a whole since 1984, and more obviously since 1996.”

“自1978年后，（这个地区的）秋季降水将减少了33%”，河海大学中国移民研究中心的陈少军告诉我们。“气候变化是一个原因。宁夏的气温从1984年以来就一直在上升，1996年以后更加明显。”

Over five decades average temperatures have risen 2.2C, beyond the limit scientists and politicians have agreed is safe for the world overall, further drying out an already arid region.

50年来，这个地区的平均气温上升了2.2摄氏度，超过了科学家和政府官员一致认为的全球安全红线，更是加剧了这个已然干旱地区的状况。

In the 1990s, as desiccation deepened, the local government decided it could not bring water to the region's scattered villages, so would have to bring them to water, first around nearby cities, later in Hongsibu.

20世纪90年代时，由于干旱加剧，当地政府认识到自己无法向零星的存在供水，因此不得不将它们迁至靠近水源的地方，先是搬迁至附近的城市，后来就是红寺堡。

Zhoutao would be one of the last villages to be officially resettled, into a bleak ranks of small brick houses outside a nearby town. Residents were encouraged to take doors, window frames, tiles and even bricks to expand their new homes, a programme that also made returning impossible.

周陶村本来是最后一批正式搬迁的村庄之一，村民们将被安置在附近镇上的一排小砖房里。政府还鼓励居民把原来家里的门、窗户、瓦片和砖带走，用来扩建新家，这个计划也使得回迁成为不可能。

“I'm not lonely, I am living a better life than before,” Wu says, in a valley where the only other sign of life is a shepherd and his herd, drifting across high hills behind. “I fear poverty much more than loneliness.”

“我并不感到寂寞，我现在过得比以前要好”，吴说。在她的村子里，能看到的唯一生命迹象的就是穿梭在村后山上的牧羊人和他的羊群。“比起孤独，我更害怕贫穷。”

Government threats to cut off power to a few light bulbs and flickering TVs after the village were eventually dropped, and those left behind says they are unbothered by officials, perhaps because they can see a few basic comforts will not be enough to revive a dying settlement.

周陶村最终被放弃搬迁后，政府威胁要断电。可是村子里只有几个电灯泡和几台时好时坏的电视，那些还留在村子里的人说自己并不理会官员的威胁，也许是因为他们明白一点基本的服务并不足以复活一个快要死去的村落。

The shuttering of the school, in a country that values education above almost all else, had already ensured that. There would be no new generation of children brought up in Zhoutao, the village killed off by climate change.

在这个教育高于一切的国家，学校关闭已经确保了这个结局。周陶村不会再养育新的一代，这个村子已经被气候变化消灭了。

“Sometimes people come back,” Wu says. “But only to visit the graves of their ancestors.”

“有时会有人回来”，吴说。“但只是看拜祭祖先的。”
