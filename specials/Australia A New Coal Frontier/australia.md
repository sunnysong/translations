#Intro
Mega mines, mega emissions

超大煤矿群，不可承受的排放量

Around 27bn tonnes of coal are thought to be locked under the ground of the Galilee Basin in the outback of Queensland. A huge proposed complex of coal mines is planned here, including the world’s largest thermal coal project.

据估测，昆士兰州内陆的加里里盆地埋藏了约270亿吨的煤矿。澳大利亚计划在这里建造一个超大规模的煤矿群，其中包括世界上最大的热能煤项目。

So are railway lines and a massive expansion of the Abbot Point port on the Great Barrier Reef.

另外还规划了多条铁路线，并计划大幅扩建大堡礁附近的阿博特波特港。

What will this mean for the Aboriginal community, the Great Barrier Reef and the world's climate?

但这对于当地原著居民、大堡礁和全球气候，又意味着什么呢？

#chapter 1
Chapter 1
My people, our land

第一章
我的民族，我们的土地


Adrian Burragubba is a strong man. His people, the Wangan and Jagalingou, have called this flat, arid outback in central Queensland home for tens of thousands of years, but now all that is under threat.

阿德里安·布拉古巴（Adrian Burragubaa）身体强壮。他是当地土著部落Wangan和Jagalingou的一员，他们部落已经在昆士兰州中部这片平坦、干旱的土地上生活了上万年，但现在这一切受到了威胁。


When the white man first came here in his great-grandfather's time, Adrian, 54, a tribal elder and 'law man', says they were thought of as ghosts - strange, but welcome enough. But later generations were to bear the brunt of the interlopers' greed. His grandfather and his father were both removed from the land and put on church-run properties to make way for a gold rush.

阿德里安现年54岁，是部落里的一位长者和“法律人”。他说，在他曾祖父那一代，白人第一次来到了他们的土地，部落觉得他们是幽灵——很特别，但还是欢迎他们。不过部落的后代将会承受白人闯入者贪婪的冲击。他的祖父和父亲都被赶出自己的家园，被安置在教会管辖的机构里，目的就是为白人淘金热让路。

“Those places were like concentration camps,” he explains. “They wanted Aboriginal people out of the way, so you couldn’t leave them. The police would take you back if you did.”

他解释道，“教会经营的那些地方就像是集中营，他们不想让土著们碍事。所以禁止我们离开。如果你跑了，警察会把你再抓回来。”

Now the rapacious outsiders are back. Massive mining operations are looking to plunder a gigantic new coal frontier in the Galilee Basin. There are 247,000 sq km (95,400 sq miles) of coal: a land mass the size of Britain.

现在，那些贪婪的闯入者又回来了。他们迫不及待地想要进行大规模采矿，想要在加里里盆地这个全新的巨大矿藏中掘金。这里有247000平方公里的煤矿储藏：面积相当于一个英国那么大。

Will these companies succeed? “Over my dead body,” says Adrian.

这些公司会得逞吗？“除非我死，”阿德里安说。

This is a story about the indigenous people – and the loss of Aboriginal lands. It is about Queensland’s fragile environment and the damage a massive new port and thousands of coal container journeys exporting coal would cause to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most precious ecosystems on earth.

本期专题的主人公是澳大利亚的原住民，以及他们失去自己土地的故事。专题还将介绍昆士兰脆弱的环境，探讨建设一座每天吞吐上千艘运煤船的巨型港口会对大堡礁造成怎样的伤害。

And it is about the world’s climate – if the complex is fully developed, greenhouse gas emissions from the burned coal would top 700m tonnes a year, bringing irreversible climate change ever closer.

当然，另一个主题就是全球气候。如果煤矿群开发完成，开采的煤矿燃烧后每年将产生7亿吨温室气体，使得不可逆转的气候变化更加紧迫。

Were the Galilee Basin a country, it would be the seventh largest contributor of carbon dioxide in the world, just behind Germany.

如果加里里盆地是一个国家，那么它将成为世界上第七大二氧化碳排放国，排放量紧跟德国。

Adrian, an accomplished didgeridoo player whose six children often perform traditional music alongside him, initially didn’t want to be drawn into the struggle. Now, he sees no choice but to lead the fight for his 400-strong tribe against what would be the world’s largest thermal coal project and second largest so-called carbon bomb.

阿德里安还是一名颇有小成的迪吉里杜管（澳大利亚土著乐器）演奏家，膝下6个孩子也时常和他一起演奏传统器乐。起初，他并不想卷入这场纷争。但现在，他别无选择，只能带领他仅400余人的部落，对抗可能是世界上最大的热能煤项目和第二大的所谓煤矿炸弹。

"This level of mining would devastate this land beyond recognition. It would destroy any sense of connection to the land. We are afraid of being wiped out completely."

“这样大规模的开采会将这片土地变得面目全非。它会破坏掉我们与这块土地的联系。我们害怕被自己的足迹被完全抹除。”


“All memory of our tribe will be erased forever due to mining. If we can’t maintain what our forefathers gave us, we will become non-existent. It will be a barren wasteland, cultural genocide.”

“我们部落的全部记忆都将因为采矿被永远抹除。如果我们保护不了先辈留给我们的东西，我们这个民族将不复存在。这里将变成一个贫瘠的荒原，这是文明大屠杀。”

We are next to Wolfang Peak, a volcanic rock Burragubba describes as ‘our Uluru’ as he explains how it was created from a rainbow serpent falling from the sky and crashing to the ground. He hopes its name, derived from a white explorer, will be officially changed one day.

进行这段谈话时，我们正在狼牙峰（Wolfang Peak）旁边。那是一块火山岩，布拉古巴称之为”我们的乌卢鲁（Uluru，是澳洲最大的单体岩石）”，他说这块巨石是一条彩虹蛇从天空坠落到地上时撞击而成。他希望有朝一日，这个取自白人探险者的名字可以正式被更改。

“We talk about yumba, which is not just where you live. It’s where you began, the locus of your creation."

“我们所说的家园，不仅仅是自己居住的地方，更是我们生命开始的地方，汇聚着我们存在的轨迹。”

“British law, Australian law – we can’t identify with that. We simply go along with it because we have to obey it, but our law is permanent.

“不论是英国法，还是澳大利亚法，我们都不能够认同。我们遵守这些法律，是因为我们必须要服从它，但是我们自己的法律才是永恒的。”

“Mining disrupts the practising of our law. This is our world, and if that ceases to exist, we will perish.”

“采矿会扰乱我们法律的实施。这是我们的家园，如果家园不复存在，我们也将消亡。”

This is where the AS$16.5bn (£8.4bn) Carmichael project, set to be the first and largest of at least six huge mines planned for the Galilee Basin, is due to launch in 2017. Adani, an Indian firm advised by UK bank Standard Chartered, is behind the project, and is planning to build a 189km rail line to take the coal to an expanded port at Abbot Point near the blue collar town of Bowen on the Great Barrier Reef.

这里就是卡米高煤矿项目（Carmichael）的选址之处，卡米高煤矿是加里里盆地规划的至少6个大型煤矿中第一个也是最大的一个煤矿，预计2017年开始建设。项目背后，是一家得到英国渣打银行支持的印度公司——阿达尼公司。这家公司正在计划建造一条长达189千米的铁路线，将煤矿运送到鲍恩镇附近扩建的阿博特波特港，而鲍恩镇离大堡礁非常近。

Environmentalists have launched two separate court actions to halt Carmichael. They believe the other mines will be less viable if they can win at the first attempt because it would mean they would have to bear the costs of the infrastructure.

环保主义者已经提起了两个诉讼，希望阻止卡米高项目。他们相信，如果能够赢得第一仗，建设其他煤矿的可行性就会降低，因为这意味着其他煤矿的开发商就要承担基建的巨额成本。

All the mines planned for the Galilee Basin would, at capacity, ship around 330m tonnes of coal a year to India and China, more than doubling Australia’s current coal exports.

加里里盆地规划的所有煤矿，每年能够向印度和中国输送约3.3亿吨煤，这将使澳大利亚目前的煤炭出口翻一番之多。

Little wonder that Tony Abbott, the prime minister, has praised coal for being “good for humanity”, providing much-needed electricity abroad and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in taxes at home.

难怪澳大利亚总理阿博特盛赞煤矿“有益于人类”，称煤炭出口将为他国提供急需的电力，同时为本国创造数万个工作岗位和数十亿美元的税收。

One key environmental impact will be on water, which, in parched Queensland, is precious. The Carmichael mine alone will require a peak of 12.5bn litres a year. In some places, the water table is expected to drop by 50 metres. The Belyando River would have water removed at the rate of 4,629 litres per second if Carmichael goes ahead.

这些煤矿项目对环境的一个关键影响是对水源的影响，而水资源在干涸的昆士兰州，本身就非常宝贵。仅卡米高一座煤矿，每年就需要最多125亿升水。在部分地区，水位预计将下降50米。如果卡米高项目施行，昆士兰州的贝尔扬多河每秒将损失4629升的水量。

#chapter 2 第二章
You can’t live 
long without water 
没了水，怎么生存

If you rely on a groundwater bore accessed by a pump near your house for your water supplies, like Bruce Currie, who has 1,400 cattle at Speculation Farm, the rampant thirst of the Galilee Basin projects is a very immediate threat.

如果你和布鲁斯·加里一样，经营一家有1400头牛的农场，而却依赖家里的抽水机来获取水源，那么加里里盆地的煤矿项目对水源的巨大需求就是一个非常严峻的威胁。

Bruce, and his wife Annette, are close to the southernmost proposed mines – the Kevin’s Corner and Alpha projects, to be operated by GVKHancock, a consortium of Indian mining power and the company headed by Gina Rinehart, the richest woman in Australia.

布鲁斯和他的妻子阿妮塔住的地方，离煤矿项目中最南边的两个煤矿比较近——凯文角和阿尔法煤矿。这两个项目由GVKhancock联合体运作，联合体成员包括一家印度煤矿巨头和澳大利亚女首富吉娜·莱因哈特所执掌的公司。

The company says it has conducted extensive studies which show the mines will have no major impact upon groundwater. In any case, there are “make good” agreements with nearby landholders to remedy any problems.

莱因哈特的公司称其已进行广泛的研究，认为这些煤矿对地下水不会造成较大影响。另外，这家公司已经和附近的农场主达成了补偿协议，应对可能出现问题。

But Bruce, a father of five, says he is “suspicious” of the consortium's insistence. He is going through a lengthy legal process with the company to guarantee his supply.

但是布鲁斯对联合体如此坚定的态度表示怀疑。他目前正在采取法律措施，以确保自己的水源供给。

“If we don’t have water supplies for us and our cattle, it will destroy our business, basically. The old saying out here is you can live a long time without love but you can’t live long without water.”

“如果我们没有水源供给，我们的生意基本就毁了。这里有句俗语：没有爱，你还能长寿，但没有水，你肯定活不久。”

Ground water supplies basically dictate whether the farm can operate and survive.

地下水供给基本决定了农场是否能够继续运营下去。

“It not only means losing our business," says Annette. "We'd lose our home, we'd lose our lifestyle, we'd lose our passion. It’s not only a case of the mines going ahead and we lose our water. It will destroy our life.”

“这不仅意味着失去我们农场，”阿妮塔说。“我们还会失去自己的家，失去自己的生活方式，失去生活的激情。煤矿建成后，我们失去的不仅是水源，而是我们的生活。”

Bruce, who reads Confucius in his spare time, ran as an independent candidate at the last state election, railing against the influence mining firms have over the main political parties and what he feels is an increasingly throwaway society. “I was flogged,” he recalls.

布鲁斯闲暇时会读孔子，在去年州里的选举中，他还作为独立候选人竞选。竞选时，他极力抨击煤矿公司对于主要政党的影响力，以及他认为正在变得冷漠的社会。

“Mining is unsustainable. They are going to get a few limited royalties to pay for this nation’s debt," he says."It would be responsible to move as quickly as we can now to renewable energy, rather than wait until our resources are depleted and we destroy other productive industries.”

“采矿是不可持续的。现在尽快转变到可再生能源才是负责任的做法，而不是等到我们资源都消耗殆尽、摧毁了其他高生产力的行业之后才采取行动。”

Tim Kirkwood, who runs a cattle station about 60km from the Carmichael mine, near Clermont, disagrees. The rail line that will transport the coal to port slices through his property, with a further area taken up by a new quarry. He believes the mine is vital to Australia’s way of life.

蒂姆·柯克伍德经营的牛养殖场离卡米高煤矿大约60公里，他对此有着不同的看法。运输煤矿的铁路线经过了他的地产，还有一块地产将改建为采石场。他认为煤矿对于澳大利亚的生活方式至关重要。

“You can be a greenie about these things, but those people generally think food comes from Woolworths,” he says. “They don’t realise that you need primary materials for things. They probably think their iPhones are created by Apple out of thin air. Mining and agriculture have always been the primary industries of Australia and always will be. Without them, we’ll be in big trouble.”

“你可以是一名绿色主义者，但是那些人一般都觉得食物是沃尔沃斯公司（译者注：沃尔沃斯是澳大利亚最大的超级市场。）生产的，”他说。“他们不知道生产食物是需要原材料的。他们大概认为自己用的iPhone是苹果公司凭空造出来的。采矿和农业一直就是澳大利亚的支柱产业，以后也会一直是。”

Rob Williams, who works as an electrician, agrees. “How can it hurt? It’s got to be good. There’s lots of habitat out there for wildlife. Koalas and kangaroos – they learn to adapt. I work in the workshop and birds fly in there all the time. Wildlife adapts to mining, so people should do, too.”

电工罗博·威廉姆斯有着相同的看法。“这会有什么坏处？肯定是件好事嘛。大自然有很多野生动物的栖息地。考拉和袋鼠，他们会学着适应。我在车间上班，经常会有鸟飞进来。野生动物会适应采矿，人类也应该学着适应。

Head to the coast, though, and the mood is darker – for here the Great Barrier Reef is under threat.

但是离海岸更近的地方，气氛更加黯淡——因为在那里，大堡礁受到了威胁。

#chapter 3
Chapter 3
The battle 
for the Reef
第三章 保卫大堡礁之战

Tony Fontes arrived in Airlie Beach, near the Whitsunday Islands, in 1978. He’d done some diving back home in California. Nothing prepared him for what he saw on the world’s largest reef system.

1978年，托尼·冯特斯来到了圣灵群岛附近的艾尔利海滩。在加利福尼亚时，他玩过一段时间的潜水。但他在世界上最大的珊瑚礁群看到的一切，都超出了他的认知。

“It was mind blowing. I saw things you just dream of being next to such as manta rays, twice as big as me,” Tony says, stretching his arms wide.

“简直是难以想象。我看见了很多你做梦才能看见的东西，比如说比我大一倍的蝠鲼，”托尼一边说着，一边张开双手示意。

“After a while you notice the small things too, like sea slugs, which are like the butterflies of the sea. Finding them is like finding a nugget of gold.”

“惊叹过后，你也会注意到那些小生物，像海参，它们就像大海里的蝴蝶。找到它们，就跟找到一粒金子一样。”

Tony began to worry about the reef in 1998, when there was a mass bleaching event. Another followed in 2002. Bleaching is a process where corals turn bright white and die due to heat stress.

1998年，托尼开始担心大堡礁的健康，那时发生了大规模的珊瑚礁白化事件。2002年又出现一起。白化指的是在海水温度过度升高时，珊瑚变白并死去的过程。

“It’s beautiful but very unhealthy,” Tony says. “Corals are generally autumn colours – browns, greens, greys. But when they are bleached they are the brightest snow while. Dazzling. Really pretty. But then after a few weeks it becomes yucky, very squishy, and then the corals are gone.”

“这个过程很美，但是非常不健康，”托尼告诉我们。“珊瑚一般都是秋天的颜色，棕色、绿色和灰色等。但当他们白化时，颜色变成了最耀眼的雪白色。真的很漂亮，但是几周后，就会变得有点恶心，珊瑚变得湿软，最终这些珊瑚就死了。”

Scientists fret that unchecked global warming will irreversibly ravage the ecosystem. Corals are extremely sensitive to changes in water temperature and can die off if they warm too much. Ocean acidification, the change in the water’s chemistry when it absorbs CO2, is also a major threat, as it makes it harder for corals to form their skeletons.

科学家担心不受约束的全球变暖现象将不可避免地破坏珊瑚生态。珊瑚对于水温的变化极其敏感，如果水温过高，就会死亡。海洋酸化，即海水吸收二氧化碳后产生的化学变化，也是一个重大威胁，因为这会使珊瑚更难形成骨架。

The reef has lost half of its coral over the past 30 years – cyclones, pollution, a plague of coral-eating starfish are to blame.

过去三十年中，大堡礁已经失去了大半的珊瑚——原因有飓风、污染和以珊瑚为食的海星泛滥。

Tourism operators and green groups laid siege to the plans to expand the Abbot Point port, involving the excavation of 5m tonnes of seabed.

当地旅游业和绿色团体尽了全力试图阻止扩建阿博特波特港的计划，其中包括开挖5百万吨的海床。

They would dump the sediment in the reef’s waters, potentially smothering corals and seagrasses considered vital for fish, turtles and dugongs.

扩建者本打算将开挖的沉积物倾倒在珊瑚礁所在的海域，这有可能使得珊瑚和海草窒息，二者对鱼类、海龟和儒艮生存至关重要。

Following an outcry that was echoed by Unesco, the government backed down. The sediment will now be placed upon land.

幸亏由于联合国教科文组织响应了相关组织的谴责，澳大利亚政府让步了。那些沉积物现在会被倾倒在陆地上。

Prof Terry Hughes, head of coral reef research at James Cook University, Townsville, says: “It’s quite clear from the evidence that the stressors on the reef are too high. The reef is struggling to cope with the current level of pollution, fishing and global warming."

詹姆斯·库克大学珊瑚研究的领头人是特里·休教授，他说，“从现有证据很容易看出，珊瑚所面临的压力太高了。珊瑚正在同时应对污染、捕鱼和全球变暖带来的三重威胁。”

“I have no doubt the Galilee Basin will damage the Great Barrier Reef. The uncertainty is over the extent."

“我坚信加里里盆地的开发将损害大堡礁。不确定性在于损害的程度大小。”

“Turning around the trajectory of the reef is like turning around the Titanic. It’s no easy task, and opening up the Galilee Basin is loading the dice against a recovery.”

“转变珊瑚礁的变化过程，就好像让泰坦尼克掉头。不是件容易的事，而开发加里里盆地则是剥夺了珊瑚礁恢复的机会。”

The northern portion of the reef has fared much better than the southern, more developed part. It is still an exquisite ecological gem. But the disappearance of the corals has cascading effects, from the small fish that hide in the nooks and crannies to the sharks that feed upon those fish. Unesco’s world heritage committee will decide next month whether to officially list the reef as “in danger”.

大堡礁的北部比开发程度更高的南部境况要好很多。那里仍然是一颗精致的生态珍珠。但是不论对躲藏在缝隙的小鱼还是捕食小鱼的大鲨鱼，珊瑚消失都会产生连带效应。联合国教科文世界遗产委员会下个月（专题发布时为2015年5月）将决定是否正式将大堡礁列为濒危遗产。

Tony wants people to get up in arms over climate change as they did over the sea dumping. He admits it will be harder this time around.

托尼希望人们能够团结起来应对气候变化问题，正如他们在解决沉积物倾倒问题上所做的一样。但他也承认，这次的难度要更大。

“We need to mobilise, but climate change is too nebulous. Plus you’re taking on the coal industry”

“我们需要动员起来，但是气候变化问题太笼统了。另外，我们要对付的是煤炭行业。”

“There aren’t many friends in that other than green groups and tourism is loathed to be associated with green groups. But the coal needs to stay in the ground and the Great Barrier Reef can be the spearhead. If we are going to lose it due to climate change, people will say ‘no, we’re not going to let that happen.’”

“这个事业没有太多人响应的原因，在于除了绿色团体和旅游业之外，其他人都不愿意与绿色团体联系在一起。但是我们都想要确保煤炭不会被开采，大堡礁可以成为破解这一问题的利剑。如果我们是因为气候变化而失去大堡礁的话，人们会说“不，我们不会让这种事发生的”。

All is not yet lost. While the green lobby is launching its legal challenges, simple economics will determine whether the excavation of the Galilee Basin goes ahead.

一切还有挽回的余地。绿色团体发起法律挑战的同时，简单的经济考量也将决定加里里盆地开发是否顺利进行。

Take the price of coal. It is half what it was five years ago and well below a level where analysts expect the Galilee Basin mines to make a decent profit.

以煤炭价格为例。现在煤炭价格是5年前的一半，比分析师们预计加里里盆地煤矿要想盈利所需的价格水平要低很多。

And then there is the reluctance of banks to get involved. A total of 11 – including HSBC, Citi and Barclays – have ruled out funding the projects, with other financial institutions fretting over the financial and reputational implications of backing the developments.

另外，银行也不太愿意参与。现在共有11家银行，包括花旗、汇丰和巴克莱，已经确定不会为煤矿项目提供融资，其他金融机构也在担心提供融资可能带来的财务和声誉上的影响。

Most of the large banks are signatories to the Equator Principles, an international set of standards that rule out the financing of projects that harm world heritage sites, and Unesco will decide next whether to list the Great Barrier Reef as in danger.

大银行中大部分都是赤道原则的缔约方，赤道原则指的是禁止对损害世界遗产的项目提供融资的一系列国际准则。而且，联合国教科文组织下月将决定是否将大堡礁列为濒危世界遗产。

Back at Wolfang Peak, Adrian Burragubba certainly hopes the mines can be halted.

此刻在狼牙峰旁的阿德里安·布拉古巴肯定是希望能够阻止煤矿项目的。
